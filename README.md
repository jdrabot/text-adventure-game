## How Did We Get Here??

As self-proclaimed gamers and nerds, our team thought that our project should reflect our shared interests. While creating an entire video game was out of the question, we landed on a text adventure variant. Hence, the diabolical tale unfolded…

## Difficulties of the Task

Some difficulties that we ran into along the way were as follows:
React in general
Certain mechanics of the game like saving inventory
Writing multiple branches for handling user choice
Sheer amount of coding (over 2000 lines of code)
Git still being a bit difficult

## Who Did What Exactly

Samuel: backend
Jonathan and Josh: frontend
Matthew and Addison: development of story

## Technologies Used

A few of the technologies used were:
React, react-router-dom
Mongodb
Reactstrap
Express
Node
tried Kaboom (did not work)

## In Closing

Thank you for listening we hope you weren’t driven too mad!
